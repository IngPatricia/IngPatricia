## Hi there 👋


I am Patricia - a software engineer in the making! Currenly at my last year of studies 🥳 🐣


- 🔭 I’m currently working on my academic projects. They are quite cool and the most exciting one is where I get to make a data warehouse from a given case scenario using Oracle SQL Developer and Visual Paradigm. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about JavaScript ES6 ECMAScript 2018, CSS animations, and JavaScript APIs.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I got curious about writting blogs for students like me so keep an eye!
