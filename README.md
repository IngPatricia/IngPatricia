## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Patricia - a software engineer in the making! Currently, at my last year of studies. Welcome!! 



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my academic projects. They are quite cool and the most exciting one is where I get to make a data warehouse from a given case scenario using Oracle SQL Developer and Visual Paradigm. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about JavaScript ES6 ECMAScript 2018, CSS animations, and JavaScript APIs.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I got curious about writting blogs for students like me so keep an eye!
